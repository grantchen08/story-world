# Forging the Swords (Zhu Jian)

By Lu Xun (from *Old Tales Retold*)

## I

Mei Jian Chi (The-One-With-A-Space-Between-His-Eyebrows) had just gone to bed with his mother when a rat came out to gnaw at the pot lid, making a noise that grated on his nerves. He scolded it softly a few times, which worked at first, but soon it ignored him and went on gnawing—crunch, crunch. He dared not chase it away loudly for fear of waking his mother, who was exhausted from her day's work and had fallen asleep as soon as her head touched the pillow.

After a long time, it grew quiet; he felt like sleeping too. Suddenly, a splash startled him awake again. At the same time, he heard a scratching sound—claws against earthenware.

"Good! Serves you right!" he thought, feeling very pleased. He sat up gently.

He climbed out of bed and, by the moonlight, walked behind the door to grope for the fire drill. He lit a pine torch and shone it into the water jar. Sure enough, a huge rat had fallen in. But there was little water left, so it couldn't climb out; it was just scratching along the inner wall of the jar, going round and round.

"Serves you right!" When he thought of how these creatures bit the furniture every night and kept him from sleeping peacefully, he felt delighted. He stuck the torch into a small hole in the mud wall and watched with amusement. But the sight of those small round eyes staring wide filled him with hatred again. He reached out and pulled a reed from the wall, pushing the rat straight down to the bottom. After a while, he let go, and the rat floated up, still scratching round the wall. Only its scratching was less vigorous than before, and its eyes were submerged, leaving only a little sharp red nose exposed, gasping hurriedly—sniff, sniff.

Lately, he had a strong dislike for people with red noses. But now, seeing this small sharp red nose, he suddenly felt pity. He reached the reed down under its belly. The rat grabbed it, rested a moment, then climbed up along the stem. But when he saw its whole body—wet black fur, bloated belly, worm-like tail—he felt it was detestable and hateful again. He shook the reed hastily, and with a splash, the rat fell back into the jar. He then jabbed it on the head several times with the reed to make it sink.

After changing the pine torch six times, the rat could no longer move. It just floated in the middle of the water, occasionally giving a slight jump towards the surface. Mei Jian Chi felt pity again. He broke the reed and managed to pick the rat out with it, placing it on the ground. At first, the rat didn't move at all; then it breathed a little; after a long time, its four legs moved, and it turned over as if trying to stand up and run away. This gave Mei Jian Chi a start, and without thinking, he raised his left foot and stomped down. He heard a squeak. When he squatted down to look carefully, he saw a trace of fresh blood at the corner of its mouth. It was probably dead.

He felt pity again, and a sense of having committed a great crime, which made him feel very uncomfortable. He squatted there, staring blankly, unable to stand up.

"Chi-er, what are you doing?" his mother had woken up and asked from the bed.

"A rat..." he stood up hastily and turned around, answering with just two words.

"Yes, a rat. I know that. But what are you doing? Killing it or saving it?"

He did not answer. The torch burnt out. He stood silently in the dark, gradually seeing the moonlight's brightness.

"Alas!" his mother sighed. "Once midnight passes, you will be sixteen. Your nature is still the same—neither cold nor hot, changing not a bit. It seems your father's vengeance will never be taken."

He saw his mother sitting in the grey-white moonlight, her body seeming to tremble. The low voice contained infinite sorrow, making his hair stand on end with cold, but in a flash, he felt hot blood boiling in his whole body.

"Father's vengeance? What vengeance does father have?" he stepped forward and asked in shock and urgency.

"There is. And it is for you to take. I wanted to tell you long ago, but you were too young. Now you are an adult, yet your nature is still like this. What should I do? With a nature like yours, can you accomplish great deeds?"

"I can. Tell me, Mother. I will change..."

"Naturally. I have no choice but to tell you. You must change... Well, come here."

He went over. His mother sat upright on the bed, her eyes flashing in the dim white moonlight.

"Listen!" she said solemnly. "Your father was originally a master swordsmith, the best in the world. I sold his tools long ago to save us from poverty; you can't see a trace of them now. But he was a master swordsmith without equal. Twenty years ago, the Queen gave birth to a piece of iron. It was said she conceived after hugging an iron pillar. It was a piece of pure, transparent blue iron. The Great King knew it was a rare treasure and decided to have it cast into a sword, to protect the kingdom, to kill enemies, and to defend himself. Unfortunately, your father was chosen. He brought the iron home and tempered it day and night, spending three whole years of his spirit to forge two swords.

"On the day the furnace was finally opened, what a terrifying sight it was! A jet of white vapor rushed up, shaking the very ground. The white vapor turned into white cloud halfway to the sky, covering the place, gradually turning crimson and casting a peach-blossom glow over everything. In our pitch-black furnace lay two glowing red swords. Your father dripped well-flower water slowly onto them. The swords hissed and roared, slowly turning blue. After seven days and seven nights, the swords disappeared. But looking carefully, they were still at the bottom of the furnace—pure blue, transparent, like two icicles.

"A light of great joy radiated from your father's eyes. He picked up the swords and stroked them again and again. But lines of tragedy appeared on his brow and at the corners of his mouth. He put the two swords into two separate boxes.

"'You only have to look at the sights of these past few days to understand that everyone knows the swords are forged,' he said to me quietly. 'Tomorrow I must go and present them to the Great King. But the day I present the swords is the day my life ends. I fear we must part forever.'

"'You...' I was terrified, unable to guess his meaning or find words. I just said, 'You have done such a great service this time...'

"'Alas! How could you know!' he said. 'The Great King is always suspicious and extremely cruel. Now that I have forged for him swords without equal in the world, he will surely kill me to prevent me from forging swords for anyone else to rival or surpass him.'

"I shed tears.

"'Do not grieve. This cannot be avoided. Tears can never wash away fate. But I have been prepared for this!' Suddenly, a light like lightning flashed in his eyes. He placed a sword box on my knees. 'This is the male sword,' he said. 'Keep it. Tomorrow, I will present only the female sword to the King. If I do not return, it means I am no longer in this world. Are you not five or six months pregnant? Do not grieve. When the child is born, raise him well. As soon as he becomes an adult, give him this male sword and tell him to cut off the King's head to avenge me!'"

"Did father come back that day?" Mei Jian Chi asked hurriedly.

"He did not come back!" she said calmly. "I asked everywhere, but there was no news. Later I heard people say that the first person to feed the sword your father forged with his own blood was he himself—your father. And for fear his ghost would cause trouble, they buried his body and head separately in the front gate and the rear garden!"

Mei Jian Chi suddenly felt his whole body burning as if on fire; he felt sparks flashing from every strand of his hair. His fists cracked in the dark.

His mother stood up, lifted the board at the head of the bed, got down, lit a torch, and took a hoe from behind the door, handing it to Mei Jian Chi. "Dig!"

Mei Jian Chi's heart pounded, but he dug quietly, hoe by hoe. He dug out yellow earth. At a depth of over five feet, the color of the earth changed; it seemed to be rotten wood.

"Look! Be careful!" his mother said.

Mei Jian Chi lay beside the hole, reached down, and carefully cleared away the rotten wood. When his fingertips felt a coldness like touching ice and snow, the pure blue transparent sword appeared. He saw the hilt clearly, grasped it, and pulled it out.

The stars and moon outside the window and the torch in the room seemed to lose their brilliance suddenly; only a blue light filled the universe. The sword dissolved into this blue light, appearing as if it were nothing. Mei Jian Chi looked intently and only then seemed to see something over five feet long, not particularly sharp, with a blade somewhat rounded like a leek leaf.

"From now on, you must change your indecisive nature and use this sword to take revenge!" his mother said.

"I have already changed my indecisive nature. I will use this sword to take revenge!"

"I hope so. Put on blue clothes and carry this sword on your back; with the clothes and sword the same color, no one will be able to see it clearly. I have already made the clothes. Leave tomorrow. Do not worry about me!" She pointed to the dilapidated clothes chest behind the bed.

Mei Jian Chi took out the new clothes and tried them on; the length was just right. He folded them again, wrapped the sword, placed it by his pillow, and lay down calmly. He felt he had indeed changed his indecisive nature. He was determined to sleep as if he had no cares, to wake at dawn and go calmly to seek his mortal enemy without changing his expression. But he stayed awake. He tossed and turned, wanting to sit up. He heard his mother's long, soft sigh of disappointment. He heard the first crow of the cock. He knew midnight had passed, and he was now sixteen.

## II

When Mei Jian Chi, with swollen eyes, strode out the door without looking back—dressed in blue, the blue sword on his back—and headed straight for the city, the sun had not yet risen in the east. Every needle of the cedar forest hung with a dewdrop, hiding the night air within. But by the time he reached the other end of the forest, the dewdrops flashed with all kinds of brilliance, gradually turning into the colors of dawn. Looking ahead, he could vaguely see the grey-black city walls and battlements.

Mixing with vegetable sellers, he entered the city. The streets were already bustling. Men stood around in rows; women peered out from doors from time to time. Most of them had swollen eyes, unkempt hair, and sallow faces without makeup.

Mei Jian Chi sensed a great upheaval was coming, and they were all waiting anxiously yet patiently for this upheaval.

He walked straight ahead. A child suddenly ran over and almost bumped into the tip of the sword on his back, making him break out in a cold sweat. Turning north, not far from the palace, people were packed tightly, craning their necks. From the crowd came the sound of women and children crying. Afraid the invisible male sword might hurt someone, he dared not squeeze in. But people pushed from behind. He had to dodge and weave; in front, he saw only people's backs and stretched necks.

Suddenly, the people in front knelt down one after another. In the distance, two horses galloped side by side. Then came warriors with wooden clubs, spears, swords, crossbows, and flags, raising clouds of yellow dust. Then came a large carriage drawn by four horses, with a band of people sitting on it, some striking bells and drums, others blowing some trumpet-like things. Then more carriages, with people in painted clothes—either old men or short fat men, all sweating profusely. Then another troop of knights with swords and halberds. The kneeling people prostrated themselves. At this moment, Mei Jian Chi saw a large carriage with a yellow canopy race up. In the center sat a fat man in painted clothes, with a grizzled beard and a small head. At his waist, one could vaguely see a blue sword like the one on Mei Jian Chi's back.

He felt cold all over, but immediately burnt hot again, as if consumed by fierce fire. Reaching one hand to his shoulder to grip the hilt, he lifted his foot to step out through the gaps between the necks of the prostrate people.

But he had only taken five or six steps when he tripped and fell flat, because someone suddenly grabbed one of his feet. He fell right on top of a wizened-faced young man. Just as he was startled and getting up to see if the sword tip had hurt the man, he received two heavy punches in the ribs. Without time to argue, he looked at the road again: not only had the yellow-canopied carriage passed, but even the escorting knights had gone a long way.

Everyone by the roadside got up too. The wizened-faced youth still gripped Mei Jian Chi's collar, refusing to let go, claiming his precious "Dan Tian" (lower abdomen) had been crushed and demanding insurance: if he died before eighty, Mei Jian Chi would have to pay with his life. Idlers immediately gathered round, staring blankly but saying nothing. Later, someone made a few mocking remarks from the side, but they were all in support of the wizened-faced youth. Meeting such an enemy, Mei Jian Chi could neither get angry nor laugh; he just felt helpless and unable to escape. After the time it takes to cook a pot of millet, Mei Jian Chi was burning with impatience, but the onlookers didn't diminish; they still watched with gusto.

The circle of people in front wavered, and a dark man squeezed in—black beard, black eyes, thin as iron. He said nothing, just smiled coldly at Mei Jian Chi, then raised his hand to gently flick the wizened-faced youth's chin and stared at his face. The youth looked at him for a moment, then slowly loosened his grip and slunk away. The man also slunk away. The onlookers dispersed boredly. Only a few came to ask Mei Jian Chi's age, address, and whether he had sisters at home. Mei Jian Chi ignored them.

He walked south, thinking: with the city so crowded, it's easy to hurt people by mistake. Better to wait outside the south gate for the King's return to avenge father. That place is wild and sparsely populated, very suitable for action. At this time, the whole city was discussing the King's trip to the mountains, his procession, his majesty, the honor of seeing the King, how low one had to bow, how they should be models for the citizens, etc., buzzing like a hive of bees. It was only near the south gate that things gradually quieted down.

He walked out of the city and sat under a big mulberry tree, taking out two steamed buns to satisfy his hunger. As he ate, he suddenly remembered his mother and felt a sting in his nose, but after that, he felt nothing. The surroundings grew quieter step by step; he could hear his own breathing very clearly.

The sky grew darker, and he grew more uneasy, straining his eyes to look ahead, but seeing not a shadow of the King's return. Villagers who had gone to the city to sell vegetables walked out carrying empty baskets one by one, going home.

Long after the traces of people had vanished, suddenly that dark man flashed out from the city. "Run, Mei Jian Chi! The King is catching you!" he said, his voice like an owl.

Mei Jian Chi shuddered all over as if possessed, and immediately followed him. Later, they ran. He stopped to pant for a long time before realizing they had reached the edge of the cedar forest. Far behind were silvery streaks—the moon had risen there; but ahead there were only two points of phosphorescent light—the dark man's eyes.

"How do you know me?..." he asked in extreme terror.

"Haha! I have always known you," the man's voice said. "I know you carry the male sword to avenge your father, and I know you will fail. Not only fail; today someone has already informed on you. Your enemy returned to the palace by the east gate long ago and has ordered your arrest."

Mei Jian Chi felt sad.

"Alas, Mother's sigh was not without reason," he said in a low voice.

"But she only knows half. She does not know I want to take vengeance for you."

"You? You are willing to take vengeance for me, Knight of Justice?"

"Ah, do not use such a title to wrong me."

"Then, you sympathize with us, the widow and orphan?..."

"Alas, child, do not mention those insulted names again," he said sternly and coldly. "Justice, sympathy—those things were once clean, but now they have all become capital for usury. My heart has none of what you call those things. I simply want to take vengeance for you!"

"Good. But how will you avenge me?"

"As long as you give me two things." The voice beneath the two phosphorescent lights said. "What two things? Listen: one is your sword, the second is your head!"

Although Mei Jian Chi felt it strange and suspicious, he was not surprised. He could not speak for a moment.

"Do not suspect that I will trick you out of your life and your treasure," the voice in the dark said sternly and coldly again. "This is entirely up to you. If you trust me, I will go; if you don't, I will stop."

"But why are you going to take vengeance for me? Do you know my father?"

"I have always known your father, just as I have always known you. But I do not take vengeance for that reason. Clever child, let me tell you. Don't you know how good I am at revenge? Yours is mine; he is me. My soul bears so many wounds inflicted by others and by myself that I already hate myself!"

As soon as the voice in the dark stopped, Mei Jian Chi raised his hand to draw the blue sword from his shoulder and, with a smooth motion, swung it forward from the nape of his neck. His head fell onto the moss on the ground, while he handed the sword to the dark man.

"Hehe!" He took the sword with one hand and the hair with the other, lifting Mei Jian Chi's head. He kissed the warm, dead lips twice and laughed coldly and shrilly.

The laughter immediately spread through the cedar forest. From the depths, a pack of phosphorescent eyes flashed, suddenly approaching, and the sniffing of hungry wolves was heard. The first bite tore off Mei Jian Chi's blue clothes; the second bite, and his whole body disappeared; the bloodstains were licked clean in an instant, leaving only the faint sound of crunching bones.

The leading big wolf pounced on the dark man. With a wave of the blue sword, the wolf's head fell onto the moss. The other wolves tore off its skin with the first bite, and with the second, the body disappeared; the bloodstains were licked clean, leaving only the faint sound of crunching bones.

He had already picked up the blue clothes from the ground, wrapped Mei Jian Chi's head in them, and strapped both the bundle and the blue sword to his back. He turned around and strode towards the royal city in the dark.

The wolves stood still, hunching their shoulders, sticking out their tongues, panting, and watching him stride away with green eyes.

He strode towards the royal city in the dark, singing in a shrill voice:

    Haha! Love, love, oh love!
    Love the blue sword, one enemy slaughters himself.
    Countless multitudes, how many lonely men?
    One man loves the blue sword, alas, he is not alone.
    Head for a head, two enemies slaughter themselves.
    One man is gone, love, alas!
    Love, alas, alas, ah-hoo,
    Ah-hoo, alas, alas, alas!

## III

The trip to the mountains did not amuse the King; added to this was the secret report of an assassin on the road, which made him return in low spirits. That night he was very angry, saying that even the Ninth Concubine's hair was not as beautifully black as yesterday's. Fortunately, she acted coquettishly sitting on his royal knees, twisting more than seventy times, which gradually smoothed the wrinkles between his dragon eyebrows.

In the afternoon, as soon as the King got up, he was unhappy again. After lunch, he looked positively furious.

"Alas! Boring!" He shouted after a big yawn. From the Queen down to the jesters, everyone seeing this was at a loss. The white-bearded minister's preaching and the short fat dwarf's clowning were things the King had long tired of. Lately, even tightrope walking, pole climbing, juggling balls, handstands, sword swallowing, fire breathing, and other marvelous tricks seemed meaningless to him. He often flew into a rage; and once enraged, he would touch the blue sword, always wanting to find some small fault to kill a few people.

Two young eunuchs who had stolen a moment to wander outside the palace just returned. Seeing the miserable state of everyone inside, they knew the usual disaster was imminent. One was scared pale; the other seemed very confident. unhurriedly running to the King, he prostrated himself and said:

"Your slave has just found a strange man with strange arts who can relieve the Great King's boredom, so I have come to report."

"What?!" said the King. His words were always short.

"He is a black, thin, beggar-like man. Dressed in blue, carrying a round blue bundle on his back, singing nonsense songs. People ask him. He says he is good at a trick, unprecedented and unmatched in the world, something people have never seen. Once seen, worry and boredom are dissolved, and the world is at peace. But when people ask him to perform, he refuses. He says first he needs a golden dragon, second a golden cauldron..."

"Golden dragon? That is We. Golden cauldron? We have one."

"Your slave thought exactly so..."

"Bring him in!"

Before his voice died away, four warriors followed the small eunuch and rushed out. From the Queen down to the jesters, everyone beamed with joy. They all hoped this trick would dissolve sorrow and bring peace; even if it failed, this time there was the beggar-like black thin man to suffer the calamity. They only had to endure until he was brought in.

It didn't take much time to see six people approaching the golden steps. First was the eunuch, behind were four warriors, with a dark man sandwiched in the middle. When they came close, the man's clothes were indeed blue, and his beard, eyebrows, and hair were all black. He was so thin that his cheekbones, eye sockets, and brow ridges stuck out high. When he knelt respectfully, they indeed saw a small round bundle on his back, of blue cloth, with some dark red patterns painted on it.

"Report!" The King said irritably. Seeing the man's simple equipment, he thought he couldn't possibly perform any good trick.

"Your subject is named Yan-zhi-ao-zhe; born in Wen-wen Village. I had no profession in my youth; late in life I met a wise teacher who taught me a trick—a child's head. This trick cannot be performed alone. It must be done before a Golden Dragon, with a golden cauldron filled with clear water and boiled with beast-charcoal. Then the child's head is put in. As soon as the water boils, the head will rise and fall with the waves, dance in a hundred ways, and sing wonderful songs. If one person sees this song and dance, his sorrow will be dissolved; if ten thousand people see it, the world will be at peace."

"Perform it!" The King ordered loudly.

It didn't take much time for a large golden cauldron used for boiling oxen to be set up outside the hall, filled with water, with beast-charcoal piled underneath and lit. The dark man stood aside. Seeing the charcoal fire turn red, he untied his bundle, opened it, and lifted out the child's head with both hands, holding it high. The head had fine eyebrows and long eyes, white teeth and red lips; a smile on its face; hair disheveled like a puff of blue smoke. The dark man held it up, turned a circle to show all sides, then reached out and held it over the cauldron. His lips moved, saying something unintelligible, and then he let go. With a splash, it fell into the water. Water splashed up fully five feet high, then everything was calm.

For a long time, there was no movement. The King was the first to get impatient, then the Queen, concubines, ministers, and eunuchs grew anxious. The short fat dwarves had already started to sneer. Seeing their sneers, the King felt fooled. He looked back at the warriors, intending to order them to throw this deceitful commoner into the ox cauldron to be boiled to death.

But at the same time, the sound of boiling water was heard; the charcoal fire was blazing, reflecting on the dark man, turning him red-black like iron heated to a mild red. Just as the King turned his face back, the man had already stretched both hands to the sky, his eyes looking at nothing, dancing, and suddenly singing in a shrill voice:

    Haha! Love, love, oh love!
    Love, blood, who is the only one without it?
    The people walk in darkness, one man's head.
    He uses a hundred heads, a thousand heads, oh, ten thousand heads!
    I use one head, and no ten thousand men.
    Love one head, blood, alas!
    Blood, alas, alas, ah-hoo,
    Ah-hoo, alas, alas, alas!

With the song, the water surged up from the mouth of the cauldron, pointed at the top and wide at the bottom, like a small mountain, but from the tip to the bottom, it swirled continuously. The head bobbed up and down on the water, turning circles, and somersaulting nimbly. People could verify the happy smile of its play. After a while, it suddenly changed to swimming against the current, spinning and weaving, splashing water in all directions, sending a hot rain over the court. A dwarf suddenly cried out, touching his nose. He was unlucky enough to be scalded by the hot water, and unable to bear the pain, he cried out.

As soon as the dark man's song stopped, the head stopped in the middle of the water, facing the royal hall, its expression turning solemn. It stayed like this for more than ten instants, then slowly bobbed up and down; from bobbing, it accelerated into a swimming motion of rising and falling, but not very fast, with a very graceful manner. It swam three times around the edge, rising and falling, then suddenly opened its eyes wide—the jet-black pupils appeared exceptionally spirited—and opened its mouth to sing:

    The King's grace flows, vast and boundless;
    Conquering resentful enemies, enemies conquered, majestic and strong!
    The universe has an end, alas, longevity boundless.
    Lucky am I to come, alas, blue is the light!
    Blue is the light, never to be forgotten.
    Strange place, strange place, alas, grand and imperial!
    Grand and imperial, alas, aye-aye-yo,
    Come back, come back, come keep company, alas, blue is the light!

The head suddenly rose to the tip of the water and stopped; after somersaulting a few times, it rose and fell, glancing left and right with its eyes, looking very charming, while its mouth continued to sing:

    Ah-hoo, alas, alas, alas,
    Love, alas, alas, ah-hoo!
    Blood, one head, love, alas.
    I use one head, and no ten thousand men!
    He uses a hundred heads, a thousand heads...

Singing to here, it was time to sink, but it did not float up again; the lyrics could not be distinguished. The surging water also lowered with the weakening song, like a receding tide, until it was below the rim of the cauldron, and nothing could be seen from a distance.

"What happened?" waiting a while, the King asked impatiently.

"Great King," the dark man said half-kneeling. "He is performing the most miraculous Reunion Dance at the bottom of the cauldron. You cannot see it without coming close. Your subject has no magic to make him come up, because the Reunion Dance must be done at the bottom."

The King stood up, stepped down the golden stairs, braved the heat, and stood by the cauldron, craning his head to look. The water was smooth as a mirror. The head lay face up in the middle of the water, two eyes looking straight at his face. When the King's gaze met its face, it gave a captivating smile. This smile made the King feel he had seen it before, but he couldn't remember who it was. Just as he was wondering, the dark man had already drawn the blue sword from his back. With one swing, like lightning chopping straight down from the nape, with a splash, the King's head fell into the cauldron.

When enemies meet, their eyes are exceptionally clear, especially on a narrow road. As soon as the King's head hit the water, Mei Jian Chi's head came up to meet it and bit hard on its ear. The water in the cauldron immediately boiled over, roaring with sound; the two heads fought to the death in the water. After about twenty rounds, the King's head had five wounds, but Mei Jian Chi's head had seven. The King was cunning; he always tried to circle behind his enemy. In a moment of negligence, Mei Jian Chi was finally bitten on the nape of his neck by the King, unable to turn. This time the King's head bit fast and wouldn't let go, eating its way in continuously; even outside the cauldron, one could seem to hear the child's cries of pain.

From the Queen down to the jesters, their frozen expressions sprang to life, seeming to feel a dark sorrow, goosebumps rising on their skin one by one; yet mixed with secret joy, they stared wide-eyed, as if waiting for something.

The dark man seemed a little panicked too, but his expression did not change. He calmly stretched out the arm holding the invisible blue sword, like a withered branch; he stretched his neck, as if peering at the bottom of the cauldron. His arm suddenly bent, and the blue sword chopped down from behind him—sword struck, head fell. It dropped into the cauldron. With a thud, snow-white spray shot into the air in all directions.

As soon as his head entered the water, it rushed straight at the King's head and bit the King's nose, almost biting it off. The King couldn't help crying "Ouch", opened his mouth, and Mei Jian Chi's head took the chance to break free, turning around to bite the underside of the King's jaw with deathly force. Not only did neither let go, but they tore up and down with all their might, tearing so hard the King's head could no longer close its mouth. Then, like hungry chickens pecking at rice, they bit wildly, biting the King's head until the eyes were askew, the nose collapsed, and the face was covered in wounds. At first, it could still roll around in the cauldron, but later it could only lie there groaning; finally, it made no sound, only breathing out, not in.

The dark man and Mei Jian Chi's heads slowly stopped biting, left the King's head, and swam a lap around the cauldron wall to see if he was faking death or truly dead. When they knew the King's head had truly breathed its last, they looked at each other, smiled slightly, then closed their eyes, looked up to the sky, and sank to the bottom.

## IV

The smoke vanished and the fire went out; the waves were still. The extraordinary silence woke the people above and below the hall. One of them cried out first, and everyone immediately screamed one after another; one strode towards the golden cauldron, and everyone crowded up, fighting to be first. Those squeezed in the back could only peek through the gaps between people's necks.

The heat still scorched people's faces. But the water in the cauldron was as smooth as a mirror, covered with a layer of oil, reflecting many faces: Queen, Concubines, Warriors, Ministers, Dwarves, Eunuchs...

"Oh my, Heavens! Our Great King's head is still in there, alas, alas, alas!" The Sixth Concubine suddenly cried out frantically.

From the Queen down to the jesters, everyone suddenly realized, scattered in panic, wringing their hands, each turning four or five circles. A most strategic old minister stepped forward alone again, reached out to touch the side of the cauldron, but shook all over, immediately retracted his hand, put two fingers to his mouth and blew on them ceaselessly.

Everyone calmed down and discussed salvage methods outside the palace gate. After wasting the time it takes to cook three pots of millet, they finally reached a conclusion: to mobilize wire ladles from the grand kitchen and order the warriors to work together to fish them up.

The tools were soon assembled—wire ladles, strainers, gold platters, table wipers—all placed beside the cauldron. The warriors rolled up their sleeves, some using wire ladles, some using strainers, and respectfully proceeded to fish. There was the sound of ladles touching, of ladles scraping the golden cauldron; the water swirled with the stirring of the ladles. After a good while, a warrior's face suddenly became very solemn. With great care, he slowly lifted his ladle with both hands. Water drops leaked from the holes like pearls, and a snow-white skull appeared inside. Everyone cried out in surprise; he tipped the skull into a gold platter.

"Oh my! My Great King!" The Queen, concubines, ministers, and eunuchs all burst into loud weeping. But soon they stopped one after another, because the warrior fished up another identical skull.

They looked around through tear-blurred eyes to see the warriors, faces covered in greasy sweat, still fishing. Next, they fished out a mess of white hair and black hair; then a few scoops of very short things, seemingly white whiskers and black whiskers. Then another skull. Then three hairpins.

Only when nothing but clear soup remained in the cauldron did they stop. They distributed the fished-out items into three gold platters: one of skulls, one of hair and whiskers, one of hairpins.

"Our Great King has only one head. Which one is our Great King's?" The Ninth Concubine asked anxiously.

"It is... hmmm..." The old ministers looked at each other.

"If the skin and flesh hadn't boiled away, it would be easy to tell," a dwarf said kneeling.

Everyone had to calm down and examine the skulls closely, but in blackness, whiteness, and size, they were all about the same. Even the child's head could not be distinguished. The Queen said the King had a scar on his right forehead from a fall when he was Crown Prince; perhaps there was a trace on the bone. Sure enough, a dwarf found one on a skull; just as everyone was rejoicing, another dwarf found a similar scar on the right forehead of a yellower skull.

"I have a way," the Third Concubine said proudly. "Our Great King's dragon nose-bridge is very high."

The eunuchs immediately set to studying the nose bones. One indeed seemed comparatively high, but ultimately the difference was negligible; most regrettably, there was no scar on its right forehead.

"Besides," the old ministers said to the eunuchs, "is the Great King's back-pillow bone so pointed?"

"Slaves have never paid attention to the Great King's back-pillow bone..."

The Queen and concubines also tried to recall; some said it was pointed, some said flat. When they called the combing eunuch to ask, he wouldn't say a word.

That night a meeting of princes and ministers was held to decide which one was the King's head, but the result was the same as during the day. And even the whiskers and hair became a problem. The white was naturally the King's, but because it was grizzled, the black was also hard to deal with. After discussing for half the night, they only selected a few red whiskers; then, because the Ninth Concubine protested, saying she had definitely seen the King have a few bright yellow whiskers, how could they know there wasn't a single red one? So they had to merge them again and treat it as a doubtful case.

By the latter half of the night, there was still no result. They actually continued to discuss while yawning until the second cock crow, when they finally decided on the most prudent and proper method: to bury all three skulls together with the King's body in the golden coffin.

Seven days later was the day of burial. The whole city was lively. People in the city and people from afar all ran to look up at the King's "Grand Funeral". At daybreak, the road was already packed with men and women; interspersed were many altar tables. By late morning, the road-clearing knights arrived riding slowly. After another long while, the procession appeared—flags, wooden clubs, spears, halberds, crossbows, yellow axes, and the like; then four drum-and-music carriages. Further behind, the yellow canopy rose and fell with the unevenness of the road, gradually coming closer, and then the hearse appeared, carrying the golden coffin containing three heads and one body.

The common people all knelt down. Altar tables appeared row by row in the crowd. A few righteous citizens were very indignant, swallowing tears, fearing that the souls of those two great treasonous rebels were now enjoying the sacrificial rites along with the King, but there was nothing they could do.

Then came the carriages of the Queen and many concubines. The common people looked at them, and they looked at the common people, but weeping. Then came the ministers, eunuchs, dwarves, and their ilk, all feigning sorrowful expressions. But the common people were no longer looking at them, and even the procession was squeezed into a chaotic mess, losing all shape.

October 1926.
